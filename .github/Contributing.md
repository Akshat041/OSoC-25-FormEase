# 🛠️ Contributing to FormEase

Welcome to **FormEase** — where forms become effortless and learning becomes meaningful.

This guide will walk you through how to contribute to the project, whether you're a first-timer or a seasoned contributor. If you’re excited to contribute but not sure how to start — don’t worry, we’ve got you. 💙

## 🌟 Why This Project Exists

FormEase is not just a codebase. It’s a collaborative learning space for:
- Exploring real-world workflows (React, Node, TypeScript)
- Practicing clean, tested code
- Working with a team, like in real companies
- Building features that solve real problems

We want contributors to **build, break, learn, and grow**. Every issue, PR, and code review is a step toward becoming an industry-ready developer.

## Finding Issues

Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/YOUR-REPO-HERE/issues) and:
- Look for labels like `good first issue`, `bug`, or `feature`
- Read the issue description fully
- Leave a comment explaining:
  - What you understood
  - How you plan to solve it
  - Your ETA

Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you before starting work 🙌

---

## Branching Strategy

Always branch out from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming format:
```
feat/feature-name
fix/bug-name
docs/update-readme
```

---

## Coding Guidelines

- Use **TypeScript** — all files must be typed
- Stick to **ESLint** + **Prettier** rules
- Use **kebab-case** for filenames
- Keep components small and reusable
- Add **comments** where necessary
- Use **clear and descriptive** variable names
- Follow **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

---

## 🔁 Commit Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
```bash
feat: add upload preview to form
fix: correct label alignment on mobile
docs: update contributing guide
refactor: clean up file upload handler
```

---

## 📩 Pull Request Guidelines

When you’re ready to contribute:

1. **Make sure your code works**
2. **Test it thoroughly**
3. **Push to your fork**
4. Create a PR to the `main` branch of this repo

**Use the PR template**. Describe:
- What you changed
- Why the change was needed
- How to test it

We'll review it with kindness and detail ❤️

---

## ✅ Pre-Commit Checks

We use Git Hooks with **Husky**:
- TypeScript checks
- Lint + Prettier formatting
- Commit message format

Run this to make sure Husky is working:
```bash
yarn prepare
```

To manually check:
```bash
yarn ts-check
yarn lint
```

---

## Writing Tests

If you’re contributing to backend APIs or frontend components, add tests when possible.

We use:
- `jest` for unit tests
- `supertest` for API routes
- `react-testing-library` for UI

Even small tests are appreciated!
