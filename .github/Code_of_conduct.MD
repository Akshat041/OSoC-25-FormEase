# 🤝 Contributor Code of Conduct – FormEase

Welcome to **FormEase** — a beginner-first, growth-focused open source project built with intention. Whether this is your first contribution or your fiftieth, we're glad you're here. This document outlines the values, expectations, and contribution etiquette that make FormEase a healthy and empowering space for learning and collaboration.

## About FormEase

FormEase is more than just a tool — it’s a collaborative effort to simplify form-based document workflows while also helping contributors **build confidence, gain experience**, and grow into professional developers.

We built this project for those who want to:
- Learn real-world development processes
- Collaborate meaningfully in a supportive space
- Contribute code, documentation, ideas — or even just feedback!

---

## If You’re New, Start Here

This is a **safe space** to learn, ask questions, and make mistakes.

We understand that getting started can be intimidating, so here’s what matters to us:
- **Curiosity over perfection**
- **Effort over experience**
- **Respect over speed**

Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Just be honest, clear, and kind. We're here to grow **together**.

---


## Our Contribution Philosophy

We care less about how much you know — and more about how willing you are to **think, try, and improve**.

What we value:
- You read before you request
- You describe your approach before starting
- You mention a realistic ETA
- You communicate if you’re stuck or delayed

We want to help, but we’re not here for **copy-paste contributors**. If you’re here to genuinely learn and grow, you’re in the right place.

---

## Assignment Guidelines

Here’s how to increase your chances of getting an issue assigned:
1. **Understand the issue** — spend 10-15 mins exploring the problem
2. **Propose a solution** — even if it’s not perfect
3. **Mention a timeline** — a simple “I can complete this in 3 days” helps

---

## Communication Tips

- Be clear, kind, and constructive.
- Keep the issue thread focused — move unrelated questions to discussions.
- If stuck, share what you tried and where it’s failing. Example:
  > “I used `zod` for validation, but the type errors persist on nested objects. I suspect the issue is with the form schema. Can you guide me?”

---


## ❌ Avoid Generic Requests Like...

> "Please assign me something."  
> "I'll make the UI better."  
> "Can I get any issue?"

These messages show no effort or understanding of the project, and likely won’t be considered for issue assignment.

---

## ✅ Instead, Try This...

> "I checked out the input handler bug in the form component and noticed a type mismatch on async calls. I’d love to fix this and can submit a PR in 2 days."

> "I noticed the PDF output isn't consistent across different languages. I’ve explored `pdf-lib` as an alternative and would like to give it a try with proper testing."

> "The mobile view for the upload screen has layout issues. Here's a mockup of my fix — I'd like to implement it this weekend."

These responses show:
- You’ve engaged with the codebase or the issue
- You’re proposing a clear solution
- You’re taking responsibility

---

## ⚠️ A Few Don'ts

- ❌ Don’t spam multiple issues with “assign me”
- ❌ Don’t use AI to write PRs you don’t understand
- ❌ Don’t ignore project guidelines or commit formats
- ❌ Don’t push untested, unsafe, or broken code

We use automated checks and templates to maintain quality — not following them will block or auto-close your PR.

## 📚 What FormEase Will Teach You

Contributors here get exposure to:
- Clean, typed codebases (TypeScript)
- API workflows and document processing
- Git & GitHub flows (PRs, commits, branching)
- Real-world issue tracking & project structure
- Testing, formatting, validation, and review

Each issue isn’t just a task — it’s an opportunity to **practice real development** and **build habits that matter** in professional workspaces.

---

## 💬 A Final Word

FormEase is built by learners, for learners. We don’t expect you to be perfect — just be present, proactive, and patient. Every bug you solve, every PR you write, every review you receive is a step toward becoming a better developer.

So welcome — ask questions, contribute meaningfully, and most importantly: **enjoy the journey** 💙

Let’s build, learn, and grow — together.
